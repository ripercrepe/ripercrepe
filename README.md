ðŸ’› Hi, Iâ€™m @ripercrepe! I'm a developer and musician
Based on Buenos Aires, Argentina. ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·


I am working as a software tester and currently working for a degree in programming at the UNSAM national university, as well as constantly becoming
familiar with different languages and technologies.

Currently learning Wollok & C# programming (coming from plain C). Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on short jams and game projects.
I am also really interested in NDS homebrew! ðŸŽ®

There's not much to see right now, hopefully I'll be able to show some
love and content for the community that I love so much
